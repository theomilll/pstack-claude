description: Spawn three parallel review subagents over the active transcript, surface learnings, and route each to a concrete edit on an existing skill. Use when the user says reflect.

# Reflect

On Codex, read the [platform mapping](../poteto-mode/references/codex-tools.md), including its per-skill notes, before following this skill.

Mine the current conversation for durable learnings, then route them into skill edits.

## When to invoke

Invoke when the user says "reflect" or "/reflect". Skip when the conversation is trivial, off-topic, or already covered by an existing skill the parent followed correctly. One-offs are not learnings.

## Process

### 1. Locate the active transcript

The parent finds its own transcript file before fanning out. The system prompt names Claude Code's per-project transcripts directory at `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/`. Use that path. Do not glob across `~/.claude/projects/`. That crosses workspace boundaries and reads private chats from unrelated projects.

Run the finder at `skills/reflect/scripts/find-transcript.mjs` under the installed plugin with the projects directory and a fragment of the conversation's opening user prompt:

```bash
node <plugin>/skills/reflect/scripts/find-transcript.mjs ~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd> "<opening prompt fragment>"
```

It covers the three layouts (flat `<id>.jsonl`, nested `<id>/<id>.jsonl`, subagent `<parent>/subagents/<child>.jsonl`), newest first, and prints the first path whose opening `user` record carries the fragment. Do not reimplement the scan by hand: the first line of a transcript is session metadata, not a message, and files run to several megabytes, so the finder streams each candidate and stops at its first `user` record. If it exits 1, write a tight digest of the session and pass that instead.

### 2. Spawn three reviewers in parallel

One message, three `Agent` calls, `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`, each on its own model as below. Reviewers need MCP access for context lookups (tickets, chat threads, observability traces referenced in the transcript). Pick a subagent_type that retains MCP access. The prompt forbids file writes. The parent applies edits.

Run the reviewers on different models: a reviewer on a different model notices lapses the others' models share. Pick the models with the Model routing section of your CLAUDE.md (AGENTS.md on Codex). With no Model routing section, omit `model` so every reviewer runs on your model, vary reasoning effort across the three where the runtime lets you set it (`spawn_agent`'s `reasoning_effort` on Codex), and say diversity was reduced. The synthesizer in step 3 then also runs on your model. If the `Agent` tool rejects a model, re-pick through the routing and say so.

| Lens | Prompt template |
|---|---|
| Judgment | `references/judgment-reviewer.md` |
| Tooling | `references/tooling-reviewer.md` |
| Divergent | `references/divergent-reviewer.md` |

Pass each template verbatim, substituting the transcript path or digest where marked. Reviewers return findings in the `Agent` response body.

### 3. Synthesize

One `Agent` call, `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`, on a strong model: it rules on every finding, so pick it the way the Model routing section of your CLAUDE.md (AGENTS.md on Codex) says to for the hardest problems. Pick a subagent_type that retains MCP access. The synthesizer's quality check includes spot-verifying citations, which can require MCP access. Use `references/synthesizer.md` verbatim, with each reviewer's full output inlined where marked. The synthesizer returns a structured Accepted / Rejected / Backlog list.

### 4. Structural enforcement check

Sanity-check the synthesizer's Accepted list. For any item that would be enforced more reliably by a lint rule, script, metadata flag, or runtime check, move it from Accepted to Backlog. See the **encode-lessons-in-structure** principle skill.

### 5. Apply

Before applying any Accepted edit, present the synthesizer's full Accepted/Rejected/Backlog output to the user and wait for explicit approval. The user picks which subset to apply and may redirect routings. Skill changes affect every future agent in the org. Do not auto-apply.

Backlog items file to whatever devex / backlog tracker your team uses automatically. Only the Accepted list waits for approval.

For each approved Accepted item, follow the Routing field exactly:

- Trivial existing-skill edit (a one-line bullet, a tightened sentence, a stale fact corrected): parent does directly.
- Substantive existing-skill edit (a new section, a new pattern table, more than ~10 lines): hand to the **plugin-dev:skill-development** skill and run its draft / test / iterate loop.
- `tune description: <skill path>` (the skill exists but didn't trigger when it should have): hand to `plugin-dev:skill-development` and run its description-optimization loop.
- `new skill via plugin-dev:skill-development: <kebab-name>`: hand creation to `plugin-dev:skill-development`. Do not invent the shape ad hoc.

If your environment ships a SKILL.md validator, run it on every touched skill before declaring done. Skip this step if it doesn't.

### 6. Summarize for the user

Short list, no preamble:

- Edits applied: `<skill path>`. What changed, one line each.
- New skills created: `<skill path>`. One line each (rare).
- Backlog filed to the devex tracker: `<issue title>` (`<tags>`). One line each.
- Dropped: one line per rejected finding + reason from the synthesizer.
