# pstack reference

Start with the [README](../README.md) for installation and your first task.

## Slash commands

The package includes 53 skill directories: 30 public skills and 23 `principle-*` references. Claude Code uses `/pstack:<name>`. In Codex, request a skill by name or install the [optional shortcuts](#codex) for the `/name` form below.

Find each skill's instructions in the [skills tree](../plugins/pstack/skills/).

| command | use it when |
| --- | --- |
| `/poteto-mode` | default entry point for any non-trivial task |
| `/how` | walk through how a subsystem works |
| `/why` | investigate why something was built this way (parallel multi-MCP evidence) |
| `/architect` | settle types and module shape before writing code that crosses a function boundary |
| `/arena` | run N parallel attempts at the same task and pick the best parts |
| `/interrogate` | have three different models try to break a diff |
| `/automate-me` | draft your own personal -mode skill from recent transcripts |

## Runtime support

All runtimes share [one skills tree](../plugins/pstack/skills/). A skills-only installation includes the skills, scripts, agent references, and license notices. The Claude Code and Codex plugins also install automatic routing hooks. Codex command shortcuts are separate.

| Runtime | Setup and recorded verification |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Code | Install the marketplace plugin. Skills use Claude tool names and model defaults; the plugin installs automatic routing. |
| Codex | Install the native plugin through the repository's marketplace and trust its hook through `/hooks`. The [Codex mapping](../plugins/pstack/skills/poteto-mode/references/codex-tools.md) translates Claude tools and model names. Shared skill symlinks were also detected in a live session. |
| Prime Agent | Its documentation describes shared-directory discovery; it has not been tested in a live session. Choose tools and models through Prime's configuration. |
| opencode | Discovery and reading a linked skill were verified on version 1.18.25. Configure agents, commands, and permissions in `opencode.json`. Its picker also lists principle skills. |
| Gemini CLI | Its documentation describes shared-directory discovery; it has not been tested in a live session. Use `/skills list` to check discovery and `/skills reload` after changes. |

These checks cover skill discovery. Delegation and multi-model workflows remain unverified on Prime Agent, opencode, and Gemini CLI. On those runtimes, agents must adapt Claude-specific tools, models, and configuration. The Codex mapping applies only to Codex.

### Automatic routing

The Claude Code and Codex plugins share a [SessionStart hook](../plugins/pstack/hooks/hooks.json) that loads a short [routing instruction](../plugins/pstack/hooks/session-start-context.md) on startup, resume, clear, and compact. Codex requires the user to trust plugin hooks through `/hooks`. The instruction invokes `poteto-mode` when a task meets any of these conditions:

- It touches more than one file or changes a signature other files call.
- It involves a design or architecture choice.
- It concerns a bug with an unknown cause or a performance issue.

Smaller tasks proceed directly. The full skill loads when invoked, and explicit user instructions take precedence.

To disable routing, create `pstack-models.md` in the runtime's config directory with the line `session hook: off`: `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}/pstack-models.md` for Claude Code or `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/pstack-models.md` for Codex. The hook reads that line before injecting its instruction. Without it, routing stays on.

Skills-only installs and other runtimes do not include the hook. Request `poteto-mode` explicitly, or add a standing instruction to the runtime's instruction file.

### Shared skills installation

Use this path for Prime Agent, opencode, Gemini CLI, or a skills-only Codex installation. Clone the repository and link its skills into `~/.agents/skills/`:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/michael-denyer/pstack-claude
cd pstack-claude
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills
for s in plugins/pstack/skills/*/; do
  target=~/.agents/skills/"$(basename "$s")"
  test -e "$target" || test -L "$target" || ln -s "$PWD/$s" "$target"
done
```

Keep all skill directories, including the principle references. Leave the clone at this path while the links are installed.

### Manage linked skills

If a destination already exists, inspect it before replacing it. The installation skips existing files, directories, and links.

To update, pull changes in the clone that the links point to. To uninstall a linked skill, remove its link at `~/.agents/skills/<name>`. This removes it from every runtime using that directory.

### Install with the skills CLI

To install without keeping a local clone:

```shell
npx skills add https://github.com/michael-denyer/pstack-claude/tree/main/plugins/pstack/skills --skill "*" --agent "*" --yes
```

The [CI installation check](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) uses the skills CLI to copy the checkout's skill tree and compare the installed files with their sources.

### Codex

The [native plugin manifest](../plugins/pstack/.codex-plugin/plugin.json) points to the shared skills directory and [SessionStart hook](../plugins/pstack/hooks/hooks.json). The [marketplace catalog](../.agents/plugins/marketplace.json) lists `pstack` in the `pstack-claude` marketplace. Review and trust the hook through `/hooks`; Codex asks again when its definition changes.

The [README installation](../README.md#codex) registers that catalog with `codex plugin marketplace add`, then installs the plugin with `codex plugin add`. These commands match the help output from `codex-cli 0.154.0-alpha.6.2`. A fresh native installation was not tested for this documentation change.

OpenAI documents [marketplace registration and the plugin format](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/build/plugins#add-a-marketplace-from-the-cli). If your CLI lacks `plugin add`, use the plugin browser after registering the marketplace, or use the [skills-only installation](#shared-skills-installation).

Request `poteto-mode` by name or select its entry, such as `pstack:poteto-mode`. To enable parallel subagents:

```toml
[features]
multi_agent = true
```

Add this setting to `~/.codex/config.toml` if subagents are disabled. Skills such as `arena`, `interrogate`, and `architect` use parallel agents. The [mapping](../plugins/pstack/skills/poteto-mode/references/codex-tools.md) describes a sequential fallback and translates Claude tool names, model defaults, and verification instructions.

For optional slash-command shortcuts, run this from the clone's root:

```shell
mkdir -p ~/.codex/prompts
for c in plugins/pstack/.codex-plugin/prompts/*.md; do
  target=~/.codex/prompts/"$(basename "$c")"
  test -e "$target" || test -L "$target" || ln -s "$PWD/$c" "$target"
done
```

Each shortcut invokes its skill. The commands skip existing files and links. Remove a shortcut by deleting its link at `~/.codex/prompts/<name>.md`. Both native-plugin and skills-only installations work without these shortcuts.

## Configuration and dependencies

pstack names no model. Skills that benefit from different or stronger models, such as review panels and design comparisons, pick them with the Model routing section of your `CLAUDE.md` (`AGENTS.md` on Codex). Without that section, they run on the session's model and vary reasoning effort where they wanted different models.

Install dependencies for the workflows you use:

| Dependency | When you need it |
| --- | --- |
| GitHub CLI, `gh` | PR monitoring and shipping. Authenticate with `gh auth login`. |
| Bun | The bundled `watch-pr` and `orch` scripts. Their bootstrap installs script dependencies on first run. |
| Graphite CLI, `gt` | The Orchestrate playbook and `orch` stack frontier. Shipping and autopilot playbooks use `gh` or Origin's CLI when available. |
| `jq` and `rg` | PR and transcript columns in `worktree-audit.sh`. Missing tools produce warnings and blank columns. |
| `plugin-dev` | Claude Code skill-authoring guidance used by `automate-me`, `reflect`, and `poteto-mode`. |

Install the Claude Code skill-authoring companion with:

```text
/plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-plugins-official
/plugin install plugin-dev@claude-plugins-official
```

Those authoring workflows need `plugin-dev` for their guidance; other workflows do not. Codex uses the equivalent named in its [mapping](../plugins/pstack/skills/poteto-mode/references/codex-tools.md#driver-and-bundled-skills-pstack-references).

Playbooks use the runtime's task-tracking tools or an uncommitted `todo.md` checklist. For Claude Code, the repository documents `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TODO_TOOLS=1`; see [platform adaptation](../plugins/pstack/skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md#platform-adaptation).

Use [create-verification-skill](../plugins/pstack/skills/create-verification-skill/SKILL.md) to record how the agent should run and check your project, following the [driver policy](../plugins/pstack/skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md#non-negotiables).

```

Skills-only installs use `plugins/pstack/skills/`. Agent references and license files are included under `poteto-mode/references/`.

### Generated files and checks

The [generator](../tools/generate.mjs) updates versions, model defaults, Codex prompts, and portable reference files. The [slash-command table](#slash-commands) supplies the Codex prompt descriptions and order. Edit that table when changing a menu description, then regenerate. Keep a row for every public skill, with `poteto-mode` first.

[Documentation fact tests](../tests/readme-facts.test.mjs) check the skill counts and upstream pin. The table parser requires the header `| command | use it when |`.

Run the generator and repository tests with Bun:

```shell
bun tools/generate.mjs
bun test tests/
```

CI also checks shell scripts, workflows, Markdown, relative links, and the bundled Bun tools. See [local checks](../CONTRIBUTING.md#things-that-will-fail-ci) for commands and [release instructions](../CONTRIBUTING.md#releasing) for versioning and the live Claude Code command check.

### Port scope and attribution

The skill tree is synced against upstream `12d587d` (v0.15.5).

This repository ports Lauren Tan's pstack from Cursor to Claude Code and shares the skills with other runtimes. It includes seven cursor-team-kit skills and an independently authored `babysit` skill. The port supplies Claude Code plugin registration and routing, Codex manifests and shortcuts, and the Codex tool mapping.

Cursor-specific automations, sticky-mode metadata, the `make-bot-ui` workflow, and the Cursor UI tutorial are excluded. [tools/upstream.json](../tools/upstream.json) records the revisions and exclusions; [CHANGES.md](../CHANGES.md) records the per-skill port changes. The bundled `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review` provides a maintainability review when a workflow calls for one.

For skill changes, follow the [sync boundary](../CONTRIBUTING.md#the-sync-boundary). Workflow changes usually belong upstream; runtime adaptations belong here.

See the [license summary](../README.md#license) for licenses and full-plugin attribution. [NOTICE-skills.md](../NOTICE-skills.md) is the notice for skills-only installations.
